* Cracking the Coding Interview
* Blind 75 Neetcode

* spot a good technology culture:

Ask the interviewer how Engineering and Product work together in detail.

If Engineering leadership do not view Product as a highly valuable ally and integrate them into the Engineering ecosystem with critical importance and vice versa, then this would be a red flag for me and I have bad news for you.

Either the leadership do not have the experience here, or its an Engineering led tech team with an ego.

Interview questions from udacity course
Perception Engineer
Given robot with radar and lidar, how would you fuse those 2 to perform object detection?
How would you deal with different refresh rates between radar and lidar?
If you have camera data coming in, how would you use that? As input or say that you bring data out of the radar and lidar and use that for something else?
Deep Learning Engineer
Explain the concept of semantic segmentation
What kind of loss function would you use?
Motion Planning Engineer
Vehicle driving down the highway, there is stop light/pedestrian, can you construct a behavior tree/finite state machine for what the robot should do?
You mentioned model predictive controller, have you worked on that? (candidate says i did parallel parking) How did you use that on parallel parking?
Mapping/Localization Engineer
Describe process how satellites determine the position of an object
Is the process something that needs 1 satellite or do you need multiple satellites?
Do you think 1 satellite is accurate enough for robot applications like autonomous vehicles?
Can you think of approaches that might be more accurate for a robotics application?
Have you ever implemented a particle filter or kalman filter?
What about filters make them better than GPS?
