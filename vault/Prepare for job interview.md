* spot a good technology culture:

Ask the interviewer how Engineering and Product work together in detail.

If Engineering leadership do not view Product as a highly valuable ally and integrate them into the Engineering ecosystem with critical importance and vice versa, then this would be a red flag for me and I have bad news for you.

Either the leadership do not have the experience here, or its an Engineering led tech team with an ego.
