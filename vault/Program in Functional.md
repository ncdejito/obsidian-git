Why functional - 
* allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.
* restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test
* good for distributed systems
* Personal experience - easier unit tests, better interfaces

Code categories
 - Actions - depends on how many times they are called
 - Calculations - depends only on their inputs
 - Data - stores input and output data

Lambda expressions
> way of defining an anonymous function object (aÂ _closure_) right at the location where it's invoked or passed as an argument to a function

Dependent types - a type whose definition depends on a value

### Example
```
// C++20
vector<int> positives = {};
auto get_positive = [](int num)
{ return num > 0; };
copy_if(A.begin(), A.end(), back_inserter(positives), get_positive);
A = positives;
