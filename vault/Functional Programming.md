[[Programming Theory]]

Why functional - 
* allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.
* restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test
* good for distributed systems

Personal experience
- easier unit tests, better interfaces
