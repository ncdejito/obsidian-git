Why use it
* asynchronous + real-time - is a design approach that uses asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time adjustments to typically static information
* prevent nested callbacks in asynchronous processes

How it works 
* [[Program in Functional]] + Observer pattern
- an observer subscribes to an Observable. Then that observer reacts to whatever item or sequence of items the Observable emits
* Composition prevents nested [[Callback]]

* C++ observable [code](https://github.com/ddinu/observable)
