Eisenhower Decision Matrix - urgent vs important quadrant matrix

Deciding to do something
Simplest most important question: Will it make you happy? What makes you think so?
The thing
What is your objective in doing this?
Why this? Why not this?
Risk
What are the chances of success? Be honest and realistic, is there proof youre right?
If it fails, will you regret doing it? Or would it still be ok?
Self awareness
Present - Are you actually able to do it with the resources you have, time money knowledge? How long/much/exactly?
Past - Does it build up the story you have written so far?
Future - If you were 80yo looking back, would you regret taking this decision?

Comparing against alternative paths
Pros Cons
Describe choices in impact, confidence, and effort
Risk

If theres no proof that people want it and are willing to pay for it, dont even do it
If you cant shoot for a robotics research workshop, dont even do it

If it doesnt solve your own current/future problem, dont even do it

What was the last thing you created?

Small code things that can work
Setting up the quickstarts for the specific tech I listed down!
Trying out new tools

If youâ€™re not willing to do it in the next 2 weeks, do not write it down
Need to edit so readily mappable to Goals doc

Factors for evaluating which idea to pursue:
Internal Satisfaction: Will making it make you happy?
Will you be excited to share it with friends?
Does it help you become the person you want to become?
If tomorrow was your last day, would you have not regretted spending today by making it?
Impact: High-value Will people pay for it?
Will you get new exp/skills after doing it?
