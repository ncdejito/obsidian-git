* Ask why it triggers you - answer could be something you really want that you are not exerting effort on
* Be patient - Appreciate your own progress. It's ok to not be there yet, as long as you're taking steps to get closer to what you want.
* Practice gratitude - appreciate the good things you do have, and avoid feeling bad for things you do not yet have.
* Practice self-compassion - you are not less worthy in anyway just because other people have what you want that you do not yet have
* Consume social media mindfully - social media is designed to highlight the good parts of other people's lives, and not show the bad (because it is looked down upon). there will always be someone better at something, just be the best version of yourself that you can be.
* Avoid feeling like a victim of the unfairness of the world - it is easier to say I am cursed because of my circumstance, rather than commit to the work you can do to change it
