Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?)

Challenging assumptions (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?)

Looking for evidence (How can I back this up? What are the sources?)

Considering alternative perspectives (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?)

Examining consequences and implications (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?)

Questioning the original questions (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?)
