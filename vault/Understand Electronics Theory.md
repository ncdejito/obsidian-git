Definition
* voltage - difference in electric potential between two points
* current  - rate of flow of electric charge through a surface
* power - rate at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit
* pwm pulse width modulation - is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts.

Voltmeters are hooked in parallel - measure charge difference between two points
Ammeters (current) are hooked in series - measure flow of electric charge
