[[Break a bad habit]]

## Specifics
### 1st Law: Make it Obvious

Fill out the habits scorecard
Make a list of your daily habits to become more aware of your behaviour. Write “+” next to it for a good habit. Write “–” if it’s a bad habit. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.

Use implementation intention
I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Use habit stacking
After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

### 2nd Law: Make it Attractive

Use temptation bundling
Linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

Join a culture
We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige)

### 3rd Law: Make it Easy

Reduce friction
Decrease the number of steps between you and the good habits.

Prime the environment
Prepare the environment to make future actions easier.

Use the Two-Minute Rule
When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.
Downscale the action so that you can start and finish in 2 minutes or less. Then, you can think about upgrading the action gradually.

Automate your habits
Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behaviour.

### 4th Law: Make it Satisfying

Use reinforcement
Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.

Use a habit tracker
Keep track of your habit streak.

Never miss twice
When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.
