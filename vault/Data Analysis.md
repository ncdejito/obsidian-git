## Get data

## Prep data
Treating missing data
- remove rows - if not a lot
- use arbitrary value - if you can make an intelligent guess about missing data
- use most occurring
- in same column add another category "missing"
- in different column add missing or not missing - if absence helps predict variable
- using the last known value

## Explore data
Ask good questions
Collect relevant info
Sense checks - compare to other available benchmarks

Tips
Ask questions/hypothesize
Inspect the data first before coding the model

Things to check
descriptive statistics
min-max values
outliers
trends
nulls
duplicates
