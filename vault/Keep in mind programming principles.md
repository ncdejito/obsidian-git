- DRY - don’t repeat yourself
- KISS - keep it simple stupid, keep it short and simple
- YAGNI - you aren’t gonna need it, “Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them”
-   [Independence in Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) - independent of frameworks (i.e. unlimited by feature laden packages), testable in isolation, independent of UI (i.e. UI can be changed easily), independent of database (i.e. business rules not bound to database), independent of external agency (i.e. business rules dont know anything at all about the outside world).

Separation of concerns
Loose coupling

[[Law of Demeter]]

Defensive programming - ensures the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances
