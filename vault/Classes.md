Combining functions and data in one object with [[Use Interfaces]]

Virtual functions
required for base classes and necessary for polymorphism

Class - private by default
> There is only one difference between class and struct, and it is that the data members inside a struct keyword will be declared public by default, while in a class keyword the data members inside the class will be declared private by default.
```
class Player
{
    string name;
};
```

Struct - public by default
```
struct Player
{
    string name;
    int hp;
    Vector position;
};
int main()
{
    Player me;
    me.name = "William";
    me.hp = 100.0f;
    me.position.x = me.position.y = me.position.z = 0;
}
```
