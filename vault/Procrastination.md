Why we Procrastinate Adam Grant Work life
- Parkinsons law - work expands in proportion to the time available for its completion
- Incentivize in my mind starting early with being able to work less hours
- When procrastinating, acknowledge that I'm probably doing something I hate or something I fear vs me just being lazy, then just do it anyway to save myself from the agony of worrying about it
