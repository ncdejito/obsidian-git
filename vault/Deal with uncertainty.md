* Accept the limits of your knowledge - you cannot know everything
* Read about experiences of other people
* Create the data and take action - bec sometimes theres no data yet to analyze and make certain, hold on to what you know is true and act from there
* Make scenarios - strive for best case but prepare for worst case
