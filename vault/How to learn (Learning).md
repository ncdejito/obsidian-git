How to learn (start anywhere!)

First principles
Critical path
On-demand, as needed

Feynman technique
1. Select a concept to learn. - What topic are you curious about? Write out everything you already know about the subject you want to understand deeper. As you learn more about the topic, add it to your sheet. Once you think you understand the topic well enough
2. Teach it to a child.
3. Review and refine your understanding.
4. Organize your notes and revisit them regularly.
How to learn
Feynman like understanding
Be able to visualize exactly what needs to be done and steps needed to be taken e.g. a data analyst gets the data, processes it, does summaries, asks questions etc.

Fast
Ask why and 1 example
Understand high-level input output method definitions
Alternatives
Headings first, Chunking
Interleaving

Solid
Apply it
- Add visible value as soon as possible - take over small part of work expert is willing or eager to relinquish
Practice
- Seek mini experiences - identify opportunities to experience in limited fashion situations that made experts valuable to organization
Retrieve it
- Varied practice
- Observe experts in action - watch them while they’re working

Tools


Something weird to associate thing with thing e.g. japanese symbols

Learning How to Learn
Chunking
Read headings first
Focus on main topics
Introduce variety
Interleaving - students mix, or interleave, multiple subjects or topics while they study in order to improve their learning
Illusions of competence
Take breaks to recall
Change your environment

ask questions to direct investigation
use structure of courses to identify thing you dont know you dont know

RIVERS
RETRIEVAL
Repeatedly retrieving concepts from memory is one of the best ways to learn them. We may think that simple rereading works, but it can be more effective to:
 
- Rephrase learnings in your own words and practice recall
- Convert salient points into series of questions then answer them
- Relate to something outside the subject that helps you remember
 
Repeated retrieval can embed knowledge pretty deep so that it becomes reflexive.
 
~ "Rereading is time consuming and doesn’t result in durable memory. And it often involves a kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content. One of the best habits a learner can instill is regular self quizzing to calibrate understanding of what you do and do not know"

INTERLEAVING
Switching between related learning tasks in a single session can help solidify learning.
 
We may think that mass practice can feel more productive. While it can help with retention in the short term, long term durable learning is greatly helped by interleaving related topics together. This can also help build your skills to look at problems and appreciate which principles you need to pull from your experience.
 
VARIED PRACTICE
Practicing the same skill in different contexts, and at varying levels of difficulty, can enhance learning. 
 
ELABORATION
If you want to learn something in depth, try explaining and describing ideas with many details and multiple examples. It can really help here to take complex topics you’re learning and distill them into analogies, components or principles if this helps you absorb them more easily. 
 
REFLECTION
Reflecting on new learning and questioning what you think are how you build new knowledge. You can ask yourself semi-regularly:
 
- What did you learn?
- Did you form opinions on what you learned?
- How comfortable are you explaining it to others?
- How are you applying it or thinking about applying it?
- What are gaps that you might want to re-study?
- Are there other areas of your life you can apply the learning to?
 
SPACED REPETITION
When you learn a new concept or fact, make sure to revisit it every once in a while to make sure that it sticks in your memory. This kind of practice is most effective when it is spaced out (leaving time between practice sessions) and interleaved with other kinds of learning of subjects.

 Forgetting curve by ebbinghaus
"To be most effective, retrieval must be repeated again and again, in spaced out sessions so that the recall requires some cognitive effort. Repeated recall appears to help memory consolidate into a cohesive representation in the brain and to strengthen and multiply the neural routes by which the knowledge can later be retrieved"


How to Learn in 2 days what normally takes 6mos

- Learn and do - knowledge sticks once it is applied (context based learning)
- Things to move forward
- Clear checkpoint
- Hard and fast timeline
- Right tools and systems
- Support structure

How to study whole fields - by me
Common sense - start with questions, concern, first principles
Graduate textbook/encyclopedia/survey paper - for basics, systematic scan of field
Money - where is the money coming from
Research papers/conferences - cutting edge

Learning direction
Obsidian, feed learnings to gdoc then transfer if recalled, feel like growing a garden again, topics obsidian, gdocs book outlines

Have a 30-second answer to everything i.e double click answer - The McKinsey Edge
