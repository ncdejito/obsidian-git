## Best practices
SMART goals + principles
Specific - definition of success, satisficing
Measurable - milestones
Actionable - subtasks
Realistic - scoped, buffered on uncertainty
Time bound - deadlines, timeboxes

5 requirements in picking a goal according to [Locke and Latham](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232501090_A_Theory_of_Goal_Setting_Task_Performance)
- Clarity - refers to the need for goals to be clear and concise, without ambiguity or complexity. 
- Challenge - means that goals should be challenging enough to be motivating, but not so difficult that they are demotivating. 
- Acceptance - refers to the need for individuals to accept and commit to the goals they are given. 
- Feedback - is necessary for individuals to understand how they are doing in relation to their goals, and 
- Complexity - refers to the need to set goals at the right level of complexity, breaking them down into manageable tasks.

What goals should look like (SMART)
1. Specific: Goals should be clear and concise, without ambiguity or complexity.
2. Measurable: Goals should be quantifiable, so that progress can be tracked and evaluated.
3. Achievable: Goals should be challenging, but not so difficult that they are demotivating.
4. Relevant: Goals should be relevant to the individual or organization setting them, and aligned with their overall mission and objectives.
5. Time-bound: Goals should have a specific deadline or time frame, so that progress can be monitored and achievements celebrated.
