## Principles
Fundamentals of an awesome resume
1. it's a marketing document, not your autobiography - dont list everything down, what will convince them to invite you for an interview
1. it's about them, not about you - they need you to fulfill a specific business need
1. it's strategic, but not blatantly inaccurate - don't lie, but frame things to make it sound strategic
1. you can be professional without being stuffy - compelling and on-point, catch their attention! lose pretentious words, make it sound like you're conversing with a real human being
1. make the words earn their spot

How to write a resume by me
- Sell the vision, not the current state
- Working knowledge - It's ok if you dont know everything, as long as you know enough to make something work
- Begin with the end in mind - write experience you need to build, to prove you can be trusted with the work
- Growth mindset
- Don't undersell yourself
- If I was a 10x engineer, what would that look like 
- Be honest about your capability using [[Assess your ability]]
