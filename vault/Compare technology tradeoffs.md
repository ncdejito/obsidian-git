Tradeoffs to consider
Latency vs Bandwidth vs Jitter
Cloud Cost
Memory vs Disk
Observability vs crashing the system from too many print statements
Checks for Deadlock

Experiments
Depends on how you measure productivity
Depends on how you scale it - How queues behave, how long does it take to recover if load balancer
Metrics can be derived from simulation, you can check time
Mocking to isolate
Test Recovery behavior when nodes fail
Simulate network latency
Stress testing
