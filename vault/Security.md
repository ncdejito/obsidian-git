OWASP 10
chatgpt description

1.  Injection: Description: Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker's malicious input tricks the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing unauthorized data. Examples: A famous example of injection is the 2017 Equifax data breach, which was caused by an unpatched vulnerability in Apache Struts. The vulnerability allowed attackers to inject malicious code into Equifax's systems, resulting in the theft of personal and financial information of 143 million people. Mitigation: To mitigate injection attacks, applications should use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or object-relational mapping tools, which sanitize user input and prevent attackers from manipulating the code. Developers can also use tools such as SQLMap, which can test for injection vulnerabilities.
    
2.  Broken Authentication and Session Management: Description: Broken authentication and session management occur when an application fails to adequately authenticate users and manage their sessions. This can lead to attackers hijacking user accounts, bypassing authentication, and accessing sensitive data. Examples: In 2017, Uber suffered a data breach in which attackers stole the personal information of 57 million users and 600,000 drivers. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in Uber's authentication and session management systems, which allowed attackers to access a privileged AWS account and download data. Mitigation: Developers can address broken authentication and session management by using strong authentication and session management mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, token-based authentication, and session timeouts. They should also ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords and session tokens, is encrypted and stored securely.
    
3.  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Description: Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive data, such as session cookies, and take control of the victim's account. Examples: In 2018, Ticketmaster suffered a data breach that affected 40,000 customers. The breach was caused by an XSS vulnerability in a third-party chatbot used by Ticketmaster, which allowed attackers to steal customers' payment card details. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate XSS by encoding user input, sanitizing HTML and JavaScript, and using Content Security Policy (CSP), which restricts the sources of scripts that can be executed on a web page. They can also use web application firewalls (WAFs) that detect and block malicious scripts.
    
4.  Broken Access Control: Description: Broken access control occurs when an application fails to restrict users' access to resources or data. This can allow attackers to access sensitive information, such as credit card details or health records, or perform actions on behalf of other users. Examples: In 2019, a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket belonging to Capital One was accessed by a hacker, who stole the personal information of over 100 million people. The breach was caused by a broken access control mechanism that allowed the hacker to access sensitive data. Mitigation: To mitigate broken access control, developers should implement access control mechanisms that restrict users' access to resources and data based on their role, permissions, and other factors. They should also use tools such as access control lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access control policies.

5.  Security Misconfiguration: Description: Security misconfiguration occurs when an application or server is configured in an insecure way, such as leaving default passwords or sensitive information exposed. This can allow attackers to easily exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Examples: In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that the personal data of millions of Facebook users had been obtained without their consent due to a security misconfiguration in Facebook's API. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate security misconfiguration by following secure coding practices, using automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities, and regularly updating and patching software and servers. They can also use tools such as security configuration baselines and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to monitor and manage security configurations.
    
6.  Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Description: Insecure cryptographic storage occurs when sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card numbers, is stored in an unencrypted or weakly encrypted format. This can allow attackers to easily obtain and exploit the data. Examples: In 2014, a data breach at Target compromised the payment card data and personal information of 40 million customers. The breach was caused by insecure cryptographic storage of payment card data. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate insecure cryptographic storage by using strong encryption algorithms, such as AES, to encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest. They should also use secure key management and storage practices and enforce password policies, such as password complexity and expiration.
    
7.  Insufficient Transport Layer Protection: Description: Insufficient transport layer protection occurs when data is transmitted over an insecure channel, such as HTTP instead of HTTPS, or when SSL/TLS is misconfigured. This can allow attackers to intercept and steal sensitive information, such as login credentials or payment card details. Examples: In 2017, a vulnerability in the WPA2 protocol used to secure Wi-Fi networks allowed attackers to intercept and decrypt Wi-Fi traffic, compromising sensitive data and personal information. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate insufficient transport layer protection by using HTTPS and SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit, ensuring that SSL/TLS is correctly configured, and using secure cipher suites and protocols.
    
8.  Insecure Deserialization: Description: Insecure deserialization occurs when an application fails to properly validate and sanitize data that is received from an untrusted source. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, steal data, or cause denial-of-service attacks. Examples: In 2018, a vulnerability in Apache Struts allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on servers and steal sensitive data, resulting in a major data breach at Marriott International. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate insecure deserialization by using secure serialization libraries, validating and sanitizing serialized data, and implementing input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.
    
9.  Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Description: Using components with known vulnerabilities occurs when an application uses outdated or insecure software components, such as libraries, frameworks, or plugins. This can allow attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities in the components and gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Examples: In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, exploiting a vulnerability in the outdated Windows SMB protocol. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate using components with known vulnerabilities by keeping software components up-to-date, regularly scanning for vulnerabilities, and monitoring public vulnerability databases. They should also use tools such as software composition analysis (SCA) to identify and manage third-party components.

10.  Insufficient Logging and Monitoring (cont'd): Description: Insufficient logging and monitoring occurs when an application fails to log and monitor security events and incidents. This can make it difficult to detect and respond to attacks and prevent future incidents. Examples: In 2017, Equifax suffered a major data breach that exposed the personal information of over 143 million customers. The company was criticized for its inadequate logging and monitoring practices, which prevented it from detecting the breach for months. Mitigation: Developers can mitigate insufficient logging and monitoring by implementing logging and monitoring controls, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and log analysis tools. They should also define and enforce a logging and monitoring policy, and regularly review and analyze logs to detect and respond to security events and incidents. Additionally, organizations can conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and improve their security posture.
