## SEO and SEMs
SEO and SEM are both related to digital marketing, specifically to the practice of getting more traffic to a website through search engines.

SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, involves optimizing a website's content, structure, and other factors to make it more attractive to search engines and rank higher in organic (unpaid) search results. This can involve optimizing keywords, creating high-quality content, improving website speed and mobile-friendliness, and building links to the website from other reputable sources.

SEM, or Search Engine Marketing, involves paying for ads that appear on search engine results pages. This can involve bidding on specific keywords and phrases that users are likely to search for, and creating targeted ad campaigns that appear when those keywords are searched. SEM can be a more immediate way to generate traffic to a website, but it can also be more expensive and require ongoing investment to maintain ad visibility.
