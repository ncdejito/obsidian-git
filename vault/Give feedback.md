The secret to giving great feedback | The Way We Work, a TED series
Micro-yes - ask short but important question (do you have 5 minutes to talk about X? I have some ideas, can I share them with you?)
Data point - ground blur words with specific examples, cut out any word thatâ€™s not objective
Impact statement - how was I impacted after specific thing person did
Question - what are your thoughts on it? make it joint problem solving
