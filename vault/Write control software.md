Drone control software
* [recommended] PX4 - whole framework for drone messaging and controls that needs to be learned, but best among alternatives in flexibility and maturity in desired features (obstacle avoidance, RTK GPS, ROS2) and documentation

* Ardupilot - most popular, but difficult to configure and less modular architecture

* Aerostack2 - promising features, [easy to try quickstart](https://aerostack2.github.io/_02_examples/gazebo/project_gazebo/index.html), but might be difficult later on to add features already battle-tested in other frameworks
