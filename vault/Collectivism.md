- Collectivists believe that one person is not as important as a group of many people. 
- They often believe people should compromise to make things better for each other instead of just themselves. 
- They also think that letting someone do whatever they want is not good if it hurts lots of other people. 

Collectivism has many different types. It can mean serving your community, your government, your social class, your race, or some other group.
