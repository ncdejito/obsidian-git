Nihilist guide to meaning
Meaning is pointing - a thing has meaning only because of how much other things are connected to it
Meaning is not completely subjective - some parts of it tie to reality (your job has no impact on outcomes you actually care about)
Ways to create meaning
Children
Helping others
Community
Fame
Network centrality / influence in social circle
Ancestors
Religion
to recognize that the dead are simply gone, forever, and that we too are destined to die and be forgotten. Is it any wonder why people cling to religion as a source of meaning?
Progress vs decay - if you worked at a dead end job, does that mean it doesnt matter if you quit right now?
Space colonization - if humans are able to go to space, it implies that our species isn't doomed to extinction within a single lonely gravity
Meaningful careers vs bullshit jobs - Through 80,000 hours of work, we're able to have a non-negligible impact on the world
Meaning according to science
We’re the only creatures able to accumulate knowledge in a scalable way
We’re small in terms of size and energy consumption, but huge in terms of complexity
“Through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.” - Alan Watts
