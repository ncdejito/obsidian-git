## Components
- [[Object]] - instance of class instantiated
- [[Classes]] - user defined type
- Inheritance - create new classes that are based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behaviors
- [[Polymorphism]] - single interface to deal with different kinds of inputs
- Abstraction - use [[Interfaces]] to hide implementation details
- Encapsulation - bundling data with the functions that use them

## Principles
SOLID - https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#single-responsibility-principle
-   [Single Responsibility Principle](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#single-responsibility-principle) - A class should have one and only one reason to change (i.e. code modified), meaning that a class should have only one job.
-   [Openness for extension and closedness for modification](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#open-closed-principle) - class should be extendable without modifying the class itself
-   [Common Closure Principle](https://ericbackhage.net/clean-code/the-common-closure-principle/#:~:text=The%20Common%20Closure%20Principle%20(CCP,have%20multiple%20reasons%20to%20change.) - The classes in a component should be closed together against the same kind of changes
