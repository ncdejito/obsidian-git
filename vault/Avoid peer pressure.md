Do not give in for the sake of social cohesion

Me questions:
Do I just want others to like me?
Will I do this if no one was looking?

Here's a set of questions you can ask yourself to check if you're acting out of peer pressure:

**Gauge Your Feelings:**

1. **Comfort Level:** Does this activity make me feel uncomfortable or anxious? Peer pressure often involves doing something that goes against your gut instinct. Trust that feeling.
2. **Motivation:** Am I doing this because I genuinely want to, or because I want to fit in/impress these people?
3. **Future Self:** How would I feel about myself tomorrow if I did this? Would I be proud or ashamed?

**Consider the Situation:**

4. **Alternatives:** Are there other ways to spend time with these people that don't involve this activity?
5. **Consequences:** What are the potential risks or downsides of going along with this?
6. **Alignment with Values:** Does this activity align with my personal values and beliefs?

**Think about Your Friends:**

7. **Respectful Friends:** Would true friends pressure me to do something I'm uncomfortable with?
8. **Equal Footing:** Is the pressure mutual, or is it more one-sided? Healthy friendships shouldn't involve constant pressure.

By reflecting on these questions, you can gain clarity on whether you're genuinely interested or simply caving to peer pressure. Remember, a strong "no" is a perfectly acceptable response!
