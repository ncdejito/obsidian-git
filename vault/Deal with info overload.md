Take a break
Take a step back, ask why you need to do this
Retrace your steps

It is ok to not know everything
You are not omnipotent

Technique: [[Satisficing]]

Are you earning money from it?
Does it concern you?
Is there anything you can do about it?
Are you doing the best action to take given the information you have?
Are you creating value?
Are you moving towards the best version of yourself you can be?

Sometimes doing something is the only way to get more information
