A service mesh is a network of microservices that are connected using a mesh of interconnected, intelligent proxies. It is used to manage and secure communication between microservices, and it provides features such as load balancing, service discovery, and observability.

In a service mesh, each microservice is typically represented by an instance of a lightweight, transparent proxy called an “envoy.” The envoys handle the communication between microservices and provide features such as load balancing, routing, and security.
