Or path integration or tracking

Make the robot follow the path by comparing its heading with the error, [[Control theory]] applied on mobile robots

Components
Path - positions
Trajectory - velocities

Methods
* Dynamic window approach DWA - path integration with obstacle avoidance
* Vector Pursuit - better for self driving cars with not much obstacles

* effort controllers - reduce jerkiness of motion https://get-help.theconstruct.ai/t/understanding-the-effort-controller-jointtrajectorycontroller/20787
