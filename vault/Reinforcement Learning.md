# Concern
Reinforcement learning aims to solve complex problems by training models to make decisions in dynamic environments to maximize rewards. 

Advantages of reinforcement learning include 
* solving intricate problems unsolvable by conventional methods, 
* correcting training errors
* handling non-deterministic environments, 
* flexibility in problem-solving, and 
* the ability to combine with other techniques like deep learning for enhanced performance

# Key components

Agent: The learner or decision-maker that interacts with the environment and takes actions to maximize the cumulative reward

Environment: The world that the agent interacts with, providing states, actions, and rewards

Policy: A mapping from states to actions that determines the agent's behavior. The policy is what the agent learns to optimize

Reward: A scalar feedback signal from the environment that the agent tries to maximize through its actions. The reward defines the goal of the RL problem

Value Function: Represents the long-term expected reward from a given state. The agent learns the value function to predict the future rewards and guide its decision-making

Environment Model: An optional component that models the environment's dynamics, allowing the agent to plan and simulate future outcomes

# How
These components work together as follows:
1. The agent observes the current state of the environment.
2. The agent selects an action based on its current policy.
3. The environment responds by transitioning to a new state and providing a reward.
4. The agent updates its policy, value function, and/or environment model to improve future decisions and maximize cumulative reward.

This cycle of interaction, feedback, and learning allows the agent to discover the optimal behavior through trial-and-error
