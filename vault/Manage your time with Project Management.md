Project management system
Backlog ideas
Define definition of done
Break down milestones
Estimate time needed
Schedule in calendar alongside load
Do

Problems with system
Not productive enough
Not engaged enough
Too complex

Needs
Prioritized - impactful
Timeboxed - Way to cut off infeasible ideas
Energizing clarity - Clear step by step in day to day
Concrete - Pace comfortably through multitude of ideas
Simple - easy to do in a tiring day
Constant - resistant to change
Well laid - distills all collected information from past lives

Definition of done

Check milestones every quarter
Fulfills needs to keep going and not change course:
Uniqueness Frontiers
Impact product
Clarity acceptance criteria, timebox
Sellable resume every month in case i get fired at dyson

Bidding for time before you add
List of projects index gdoc
Each gdoc milestones time estimates
Gdrive folder for potential projects

Ideal time budget

System

## Monthly
month - output=OKRs, answers to retro questions
if end of quarter, write goals
else
review weekly reflections
write key results for the month in key results
move reflections to archived reflections doc

Long term - 3mo
Objectives
Key Results - gdocs, projects delivered

Medium - 2weeks
Milestones - output-based, deadlines

Milestones
Output-based
Deadlined - with reminder, Easy to move deadlines
Sign of progress - cards
Great feeling of beating deadline
Paste output on card
Mobile app ease of use

How to Scope
Output= next steps, time allocations, deadlines
Go through all the steps to make sure you know in detail the work to be done
Scope the steps needed to be taken
make it so clear you want to do it now, thats when you know youve scoped well
Add alternatives if some methods are too experimental or might not work

## Weekly
week - output=gcal entries
do weekly reflections
review tasks done from last week
compare time spent with time planned
plan what tasks need to be done next week
plan week ahead

Gcalendar for milestones
Need: 1 place for all deadlines across multiple projects
Just input next deliverable
Each milestone Set deadlines and reminders
Plan work blocks within the week for milestone subtasks

assume you're the laziest shit ass engineer but doesnt compromise on quality

Time management
Schedule deadlines per day instead of calendar entries
Planned using GCal - change only by moving blocks
Actual using Toggl

Sun 10pm 2h Scoping and scheduling tasks for the week
Retro
Check tasks accomplished in GCal day headers
Read reflections this week
Compare hours worked in Toggl vs planned in GCal
Deliverables and deadlines
Write tasks for next week for current projects
Budget 30h time
Schedule deadlines in calendar
Schedule blocks in calendar
Review next steps in project docs
Double check deadlines
Does the actions of each day reinforce your identity?

## Daily

5pm cutoff
1h if stuck ask for help

day - output=standup notes
review toggl track
review project docs
write done doing todo blockers
write feelings
plan day ahead

Short - tomorrow
Tasks - process-based, gdocs daily journal, Airtable deliverables
Time tracking - toggl

Schedule in alarms
Daily habits
Money withdrawal schedule

Cutoff work at 5pm
Just show up, 
do as much as you can
ask what will make me sleep better later

If overwhelmed and procrastinating against a deadline: spend the time you allocated, and see if you can make progress

run timer for planned timeblocks no pausing
Every night Adjust next day based on the day you want to have
On the day itself, run toggl trigger and just show up no matter how inefficient you think youre working

Plan for the day you want to have

Tasks for tomorrow must be aligned to long term

## Hourly
Timebox
When finishing the end, list down immediate next step for next session

Learning direction
Obsidian, feed learnings to gdoc then transfer if recalled, feel like growing a garden again, topics obsidian, gdocs book outlines

simplify time tracking entries to goal oriented categories
