Influences your mood

- **Endorphin**: Acts as the body's natural painkiller, reducing pain perception and boosting feelings of well-being.
- **Serotonin**: Regulates mood, sleep, and appetite, contributing to feelings of happiness and emotional stability.
- **Dopamine**: Involved in reward and pleasure systems, it plays a key role in motivation, learning, and movement.
- **Oxytocin**: Promotes bonding, trust, and social connection, often referred to as the "love hormone."
- **Adrenaline**: Prepares the body for a "fight or flight" response by increasing heart rate, blood flow, and energy levels.
- **Cortisol**: Manages stress by regulating metabolism, immune response, and energy during prolonged stress situations.
