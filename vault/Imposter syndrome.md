Because of your profession (where appearance of intelligence plays large role in success)
Because of your family environment (lack of human warmth breeds insecure overachievers)
Because society doesnt expect you to succeed
Because you were the firstborn (panganay)

""Neurotic impostors, however, are seldom benign in their perfectionism. They are “absolute” perfectionists, who set excessively high, unrealistic goals and then experience self-defeating thoughts and behaviors when they can’t reach those goals. They are driven by the belief that they are currently not good enough, but that they could do better if only they worked harder. For this reason, perfectionism often turns neurotic impostors into workaholics. Fearing discovery of their “fraudulence,” they burden themselves with too much work to compensate for their lack of self-esteem and identity. Work/life balance is a meaningless concept to them.

""The vicious cycle begins when the impostor sets impossible goals. She fails to reach these goals, of course (because no one could reach them), then tortures herself endlessly about the failure, which incites further self-flagellation, accentuates the feelings of imposture, and inspires her to designate yet another unattainable set of goals—and the entire cycle of workaholism and fraudulence begins again.

Learn to be a healthy perfectionist
Strive to do as well as possible for yourself and not worry excessively about mistakes
Avoid defensive pessimism and self handicapping
When things go wrong, they think it reveals something essential about their lack of ability and talent. They respond via 2 things
Defensive pessimism - fearing the worst and trying to avoid it from happening, for example through working excessively hard
Self handicapping - when you deliberately imperil your chances, for example by procrastinating and only working on a project last-minute, thus giving yourself a ready-made excuse for when things go wrong

These two approaches sound like a contradiction, but actually each feeds into a similar spiral of harmful thinking that can turn fleeting feelings of Imposterism into a chronic, debilitating state of mind. If and when, despite all this negative thinking, success comes, the defensively pessimistic Imposter, rather than celebrating, interprets his/her achievement as due to unsustainable levels of effort – and assumes that this grind was much more than anyone else needed to invest. The procrastinating Imposter, meanwhile, sees his success as surely due to luck. (Because after all, he just winged it.)

If this way of working sounds familiar, perhaps you are trapping yourself in an Imposter mindset. Part of the solution is to revisit your motives. Try to rediscover, if you can, the joy of creation for its own sake. Don’t see the outcome of your next project as some kind of barometer of your worth. Believe in yourself and break the Imposter spiral by putting in the work and effort that you feel this particular project deserves and requires based on its merit and difficulty level.
