Ex trauma: peers always seem to be doing better than me

In psychology, an inferiority complex refers to a chronic and deeply ingrained sense of inadequacy or low self-esteem, often stemming from perceived shortcomings or deficiencies[1]. This concept was first introduced by Alfred Adler in 1907 and is characterized by feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, lack of motivation, and struggles with social skills and performance[1].

Key signs that someone might have an inferiority complex include:

* Feeling quick to withdraw or belittle others
* Constantly seeking to prove one's worth
* Blaming others for one's misfortunes
* Being overly critical of others' work
* Being extremely sensitive to criticism and reacting defensively
* Lacking self-esteem and feeling like one does not measure up[1][2]

To move past an inferiority complex, it's essential to practice positive self-talk, engage in physical activity to boost self-esteem, and consider seeking professional help through therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)[1]. Recognizing and addressing the underlying causes of the complex, which may stem from childhood experiences or relationships, is also crucial[2]. By acknowledging and working through these feelings, individuals can develop a more positive and realistic self-image, leading to improved mental health and well-being[1][2].
