the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input

Auxiliary Space - is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. 

Space complexity - refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution.
Space Complexity of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 

Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though
