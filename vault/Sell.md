5 common excuses not to buy and how to counteract them
Circumstances
* time - not a good time right now
	* macro (seasonal) - this is a busy season for me
		* busy is best time
		* your gonna be busy again, why not figure it out now, you want this to last right?
		* get support when you need it most (when youre busy)
	* micro (hours) - i dont have a lot of time in my day
		* someone else with less making it happen? if they can do it you can do it too (it's about how you allocate)
		* cut off 90% of time that is not working - if you keep doing the things youre doing youll keep getting the things youre getting
	* when/then fallacy - when i have time ill start, but it's actually flipped (when you do have time then whats the point of the program?)
		* don't start when situation is perfect because situation will never be perfect, you make it perfect by starting now
* value - i cant afford it
	* a lot is good
		* exactly why youll be successful, because it means a lot to you
		* would you believe it did what i said if it's 1/10th the price?
		* how long do you want "i cant afford it" to be on your list of problems in life
	* it's not a lot
		* at what point is it worth it for you? if it's worth it then > 
		* what would make you believe this will work?
		* compare against other programs - how long would it take for other alternatives
	* what is money good for
		* this money is gonna be spent either way
		* you're buying lessons from the program either way - pay for it in money or in time
		* what's money good for anyway?
		* best case/worst case, both options risk free, only one gets you to your goal
	* why you dont need money
		* resourcefulness, not resources
		* you already have resourcefulness - unexpected bill, life saving surgery
* fit - not sure if it's for me
	* new identity, new priorities
	* pain of change - you gotta change to change, if you keep doing what your doing youll keep getting what you're getting
		* pain of change > pain of staying the same
	* hypothetical - if this were perfect would you do it
Others
* authority - have to talk to partner/spouse
	* isolate and collapse foil - what do you think they wouldnt like?
	* realize you never needed permission
	* realize they've already given you permission
Self
* avoidance - i need to think about it
	* past
		* youve been deciding for years
		* are you maybe here because you struggle to pull the trigger in the past
		* tired of another year of almost? dont let a bad decision burn you twice
	* present
		* we dont need time, we need information
		* product, us, you, access to $
		* which future are you deciding to cut off?
	* future
		* what does life look like 5yrs in the future if you keep doing what youre doing
		* both cases risk free - if you fail you learn, if you succeed great
		* if you're gonna eventually, might as well start today
		* instead of this is it decisions, let's just get closer in the right direction
