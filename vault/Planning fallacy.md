Planning Fallacy - predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task display an optimism bias and underestimate the time needed. This phenomenon sometimes occurs regardless of the individual's knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned

Ways to counteract
Segmentation effect - time allocated for a task being significantly smaller than the sum of the time allocated to individual smaller sub-tasks of that task
Implementation intentions - concrete plans that accurately show how, when, and where one will act
Reference class forecasting - predict the future by looking at similar past situations and their outcomes
