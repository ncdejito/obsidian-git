[[Think clearly]]

Here are the 10 famous writing tips by David Ogilvy:

1) Read the Roman-Raphaelson book on writing. Read it three times.
2) Write the way you talk. Naturally.
3) Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.
4) Never use jargon words.
5) Never write more than two pages on any subject.
6) Check your quotations.
7) Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it.
8) If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.
9) Make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.
10) If you want ACTION, donâ€™t write. Go and tell the guy what you want.
