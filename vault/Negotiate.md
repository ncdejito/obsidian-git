## Principles
The adversary is the situation, not the person at the other side of the table. Not zero-sum, cultivate collaboration
- Show good faith - you are not here to deceive or exploit, sometimes showing deference can be key
- Become genuinely interested in what drives the other - understanding motivations help you navigate negotiation effectively
- Build trust based influence using tactical empathy - demonstrate how deeply you're thinking about their words
	- trust based influence - positive collaborative atmosphere you aim to establish
	- tactical empathy - deliberate influencing of counterpart's emotions for building trust-based influence
To try and take out emotions in a negotiation is a fool's errand
- Work to deactivate negative feelings - mirror and label
- Aim to magnify positive emotions

## Techniques
- Voice
	- Assertive - like a punch in the nose (always counterproductive)
	- Playful/accomodating - bearer of truths delivered gently, use 80% of the time
	- Late-night FM DJ - soothing downward lilt, use 10-20%
	- Inquisitive - inflection of genuine curiosity and interest in person's point of view
	- Declarative - as if you're stating a fact
- Mirroring - repetition of keywords used by your negotiating partner; 
	- rapport building; 
	- gather intel - using with inquisitive tone leads counterpart to repeat themselves and elaborate and offer additional detail
- Labeling - give voice to other's feelings, it looks like.. it seems like.. you look like..
	- Avoid first-person pronouns - what I'm hearing is.. I think..
	- Helps overcome negative emotions, you might need to use a lot
	- Mislabeling - intentional misidentification, give other person opportunity to correct you, people love being right
- Dynamic Silence - pausing, magnifies impact of mirrors and labels
- Calibrated questions - how and what questions 
	- change power dynamic of negotiation and force consideration of your position
		- How am I supposed to do that?
		- What's going to happen if I do that?
	- Why questions sound accusatory (why did you do that) > change to "what" (what were you trying to accomplish)


## Strategies
- Accusations audit - create a comprehensive list of all the negative assumptions, thoughts, and feelings you think the other side may be harboring against you. You want the other side to come back and say, “Hold on, you’re being too hard on yourself.”
- Yes and no questions - 3 types of yes answers
	- Yes as commitment - agree
	- Yes as confirmation - affirm commitment
	- Yes as counterfeit - doesnt trust you, feels trapped, wants you to go away
- Defeating Fear of Loss - If you get the sense that the people across the table think you’re being unfair, encourage them to speak their minds about it.
	* The key to negotiation may be deference, but that doesn’t equate to subservience.
- Bargaining strategies
	* Establish a target price for the goods you want to buy.
	* Make an initial offer at 65 percent of your target price.
	* Assuming no deal, raise your price by 20 percent.
	* Assuming no deal, raise your price by 10 percent.
	* If still no deal, raise by another 5 percent.
	* Your final offer should be an odd number, and you should be prepared to include some non-monetary compensation to show them you’re committing all of your available resources.
- Decoding body language and speech patterns
	- Pinocchio effect - People who are being dishonest tend to use more words and effort than necessary to communicate their point.
	- 7-38-55 effect - 7perc spoken words, 38 by tone of voice, 55 through body language
- Find the black swans - pieces of innocuous information that, if revealed, can change the course of the whole negotiation. To discover them, you must open your mind, maintain an endless curiosity, and be on the lookout for surprises.
