## Factors to consider

1. Reliability - errors of hardware, software, human
1. Scalability - load, performance
1. Maintainability - operability, simplicity, evolvability


Factors not usually taken into account by new distributed programmers: [Fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)

1.  The network is reliable; - spaced out swarm movement to maintain connectivity?
2.  Latency is zero;
3.  Bandwidth is infinite;
4.  The network is secure;
5.  Topology doesn't change;
6.  There is one administrator;
7.  Transport cost is zero;
8.  The network is homogeneous.
