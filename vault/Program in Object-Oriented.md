- Object
- Class
- Inheritance - create new classes that are based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behaviors
- Polymorphism - single interface to deal with different kinds of inputs
	- Templates - apply same class to different data types
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation - bundling data with the functions that use them

Virtual functions

required for base classes and necessary for polymorphism
