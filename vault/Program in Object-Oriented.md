- Object - instance of class instantiated
- [[Classes]]
- Inheritance - create new classes that are based on existing classes, inheriting their properties and behaviors
- [[Polymorphism]] - single interface to deal with different kinds of inputs
- Abstraction - [[Use Interfaces]]
- Encapsulation - bundling data with the functions that use them

Bad design patterns
- law of demeter - too much chaining of objects inside the object

[[Program in C++]]
