State Machine - abstraction used for designing algorithms; read input, switch state

State machines can be:
Finite - limited number of states
Deterministic - one input, one transition
Non-deterministic - one input, multiple transitions


For any non-deterministic state machine, there is an equivalent deterministic state machine.

Example
Regular expressions - functionally equivalent with FSM
(Lifecycle) [Managed nodes](https://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html) in [[Use ROS2]]

Connections
Functional programming prevents unpredictable behavior?
Markov chains?
