What is a good framework for ranking ideas to build in terms of impact, ease of implementation, potential future benefit? I am a software engineer looking to build small projects

There are various frameworks you could use to rank ideas for building small projects in terms of impact, ease of implementation, and potential future benefit. One popular framework is the ICE framework, which stands for Impact, Confidence, and Ease.

Impact: The first step in this framework is to assess the potential impact of each idea. Consider how much value the project could create for your users, stakeholders, or customers. This can include factors such as revenue generation, user engagement, and solving a particular pain point.

Confidence: Next, evaluate how confident you are in your ability to execute the idea successfully. Consider factors such as your level of expertise in the required technologies and the availability of the necessary resources, such as time, budget, and team members.

Ease: Finally, consider the ease of implementation. This includes factors such as the time required to build the project, the complexity of the implementation, and the potential roadblocks that may arise.

Once you have evaluated each idea based on these three criteria, you can rank them accordingly. Ideas with high impact, high confidence, and low implementation complexity should be prioritized over others.

Another framework you could consider is the RICE framework, which stands for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort. This framework is similar to ICE, but also includes the potential reach of the project as a factor to consider.

Reach: Consider the number of users or customers who would benefit from the project, as well as the potential impact it could have on their experience.

Impact: Evaluate the potential impact of the project, as described above.

Confidence: Assess your confidence in your ability to execute the project successfully.

Effort: Consider the resources required to implement the project, including time, budget, and team members.

By using these frameworks or others like them, you can systematically evaluate and rank ideas for small projects and determine which ones to pursue first.
