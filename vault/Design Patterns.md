Interface Driven Design

Domain Driven Design

* Observer pattern - ros nodes and topics, 
used for implementing distributed event handling systems

* Iterator pattern - pytorch dataset class, 
provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation e.g. if your dataset changed from list to tree, e.g. commits in ros data structure change for efficiency
decouples data iteration e.g. for loop if list, from algorithms
