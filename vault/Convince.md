Part One
Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain. (It rarely helps the situation)
Give honest sincere appreciation.
Arouse in the other person an eager want.


Part Three
Win People To Your Way Of Thinking

The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it. (Because even if you win, you aren’t going to get what you want.)
Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong.”
If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. (A good way to start is to admit that you could be mistaken.)
Begin in a friendly way.
Get the other person saying “yes, yes” immediately.
Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.
Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.
Appeal to the nobler motives. (Even if deep down they make the decision based on the baser ones. Everyone wants to be the hero of their own story.)
Dramatize your ideas. (A picture and a story are worth a thousand words.)
Throw down a challenge. (Do this when all else fails.)
