How to find something to make
Find an industry that can be automated towards the 21st century  
Take an unemotional look at the market. It does not care what you like doing.  
Make something people want  
Make something so good people tell their friends about it

Product market fit  
When its broken but people still use it  
When big brands organically find it and pay for it  
Very strong feedback even from a small group of people
