Design thinking is a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions. 

It involves five stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. 

Here is a possible program that you can follow for one hour:

Empathize (10 minutes): In this stage, you want to gain an empathic understanding of yourself and your needs. You can do this by asking yourself some questions, such as:
What are my values, passions and goals?
What are the challenges and opportunities that I face in my current situation?
What are the things that make me happy, fulfilled and motivated?
How do I want to grow and learn as a person?
What are the aspects of my life that I want to improve or change?
Your output for this stage should be a list of insights and observations about yourself and your needs.

Define (10 minutes): In this stage, you want to state your needs and problems in a clear and concise way. You can do this by synthesizing the insights and observations from the previous stage and framing them as problem statements. For example:
I need to find a career that aligns with my values and passions.
I need to balance my work and personal life better.
I need to develop new skills and competencies to achieve my goals.
Your output for this stage should be a list of problem statements that capture your needs and challenges.

Ideate (15 minutes): In this stage, you want to challenge assumptions and create ideas that address your needs and problems. You can do this by brainstorming, mind mapping, sketching, or using any other creative technique that helps you generate as many ideas as possible. For example:
I could explore different career options that match my interests and values.
I could create a schedule that prioritizes my well-being and happiness.
I could enroll in an online course or join a community that helps me learn new skills.
Your output for this stage should be a list of ideas that are potential solutions to your problems.

Prototype (10 minutes): In this stage, you want to start to create solutions that are low-effort and easy to test. You can do this by selecting one or more ideas from the previous stage and turning them into tangible prototypes, such as mockups, storyboards, diagrams, or role plays. For example:
I could create a mockup of a resume that highlights my values and passions.
I could create a storyboard of a typical day that follows my ideal schedule.
I could create a diagram of a learning plan that outlines my goals and resources.
Your output for this stage should be one or more prototypes that represent your solutions.

Test (15 minutes): In this stage, you want to try your solutions out and get feedback. You can do this by sharing your prototypes with someone you trust, such as a friend, a mentor, or a coach, and asking them for their honest opinions and suggestions. For example:
How does my resume reflect my values and passions?
How does my schedule support my well-being and happiness?
How does my learning plan help me achieve my goals and learn new skills?
Your output for this stage should be a list of feedback and learnings that you can use to improve your solutions.
I hope this program helps you build a vision for your ideal life. Remember, design thinking is a non-linear and iterative process, so you can always go back and forth between the stages and refine your solutions until you are satisfied. Good luck and have fun!
