Article howto be an independent researcher
Just improving on others work is a viable research strategy
Discussing the paper with someone puts much greater pressure on not taking unintended shortcuts
Spend some time doing other smaller projects that you think are useful - write an open source tool, implement a known paper

Lesson 1: If you spend too much time publishing incremental research, you will never have the time to work on interesting projects you actually care about.

Lesson 2: Aim for top venues in your research field when you start a new project. If you already know that the idea is not so great and doesn't have a chance, don’t even work on it. 

(It is okay to later publish in a lower venue once you understood the limitations)

Lesson 3: We are all biased toward our own research ideas and opinions. Let your colleagues criticize your work early before it is too late. OTOH, something you are skeptical about may turn out to be a great project.

Lesson 4: Ideas are cheap and everyone has a lot of them. Execution is expensive. Use your resources wisely and collaborate with people on their ideas.

Lesson 5: Don’t collaborate with assholes.
