### Why
Why need better personal knowledge management  
siloed knowledge collection - unupdated pages, logging across different journals is unsustainable  
slow tedious recall and updating with so much hierarchies and need for classifications - need to make it seamless and compounding if you're going to last long in the knowledge economy  
  
  
how obsidian addresses these  
  
one page per tool  
best practices - links to blogposts  
setup guide  
common workflows - docker saving  
common bugs section - bugfixes

Pain points addressed
recording past bugfixes - currently: gdocs - isolated and hard to search  
listing down future tips but not implemented yet - currently: gdocs - scattered  
listing down daily tasks - currently: gdocs, gkeep - scattered  
  
decision why obsidian for tech notetaking  
- rolling unfinished tasks via a daily task log  
- quicksearch of code gists with tags  
- faster recall vs rediscovering the answer in stackoverflow searches  
  
focus on building the robot system  

Can be used for learning CS
gdrive CS notes are untouched bec hard to  
- CS knowledge is very interconnected and isolated gdocs doesnt seem to be the best solution  
- tech talks articles podcasts
- add existing implementations (cluttering the delibot repo as a result)  
  
needs  
- capture ephemeral thoughts
- formalize to long-lasting bodies of knowledge

BenCodeZen - prevent siloed notes by replacing create new note with search notes

Bugs encountered section in ros nav2 page  
  
Learnings  
Write notes based on how you expect to use them in the future - make clear headings  
Prevent siloed knowledge (folder), too much content (tag search) by linking notes  
Navigate related notes easily by making higher order notes/MOCs  
also easy updating of links  
  
Why not dailies  
- i dont need to recall finished tasks  
  
Possible idea:  
Checkin checkout system - Git commit  
  
Decision: Pause for the moment, rethink once you have a lot of notes, keep basic first i.e. one note per item you want to save

* Zotero + Obsidian, useful for MLRs who want to keep track of research papers etc. (my reco is to install Zotero chrome extension and use it as your primary interface) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGJH08ZfCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGJH08ZfCs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGJH08ZfCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGJH08ZfCs))
