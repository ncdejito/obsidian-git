[[Robotics Theory]]!
Used in [[Robotics Conferences]]

Build foundational knowledge to support debugging intuition: 
- Nav2 Navigation Framework, SLAM toolbox paper, Graph-SLAM, Behavior Trees, ROS2 Middleware Framework
- quickstart on openrmf, ros2control, rclUE4
- Journal of field robotics - read
- one liners for papers in obsidian
- watch email ITU seminar and take notes on obsidian

Personal Interests
- slam navigation for autonomous mobile robots, 
- interplanetary wireless communication and control, 
- payload capacity to motor size and body design, 
- distributed connectivity in constrained environments, 
- puzzle box systems or origami for load rearrangement, 
- decentralized control of robots, 
- distributed or graph-based multi-agent learning for mapping the physical world!


Ideas
Navigation using python + 360 camera for easier maintenance vs ROS
Polymath Robotics APIs
