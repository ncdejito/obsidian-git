[[Learning]]

## Start with the basics
Read papers
Read through definitions
Break down concepts

## Learning a new framework
Run through quickstart- just to check it works
- Avoid searching one off solutions on stackoverflow
Break down system into components
Understand their interactions
Check end to end flow for one transaction

## Learning and Ego
Learning is ego-driven
I want to make this work
Is this really worth my time
I am what I create, and i can only create if i understand
When stuck dont doubt your capability, break down to smaller subproblems and answer those first

Learning is ego-less
Let go of confirmation bias - use when pursuing hypothesis, but have multiple hypotheses
I am an expert in another field, i dont need to prove myself in this one anymore
Investing time on one method vs studying multiple approaches
