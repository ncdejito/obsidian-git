[[Programming Theory]]

Why functional - 
* allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.
* restricting side effects, programs can have fewer bugs, be easier to debug and test

callbacks - is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
