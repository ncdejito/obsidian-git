[[Programming Theory]]

Why use it
* asynchronous + real-time - is a design approach that uses asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time adjustments to typically static information
* prevent nested callbacks in asynchronous processes

How it works 
- an observer subscribes to an Observable. Then that observer reacts to whatever item or sequence of items the Observable emits  
* Composition prevents nested [[Callbacks]]
